count() - counts occurrences of value
numbers = #(1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5)
print(numbers.count(2))  # 3

# index() - returns first index of value
print(numbers.index(4))  # 4

# Since tuples are immutable, they have fewer methods than lists
# Common operations with tuples:
print(len(numbers))      # Length
print(3 in numbers)      # Membership
print(numbers + (6,7))   # Concatenation
print(numbers * 2)       # Repetition
